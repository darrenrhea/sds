# segmentation_data_utils

If everyone has to make up their own convention on how to stage
originals and masks, both for the full-frame/perspective case and
for the flattened LED boards / flattened ad boards case, 
there is going to be a problem, because surely no two people will do it the same way.

## Install

This is a private Python library that you should install like this:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:darrenrhea/segmentation_data_utils
cd segmentation_data_utils
pip install -e . --no-deps
```
