# nuke_texture_rendering

Renders flat textures into photographs under camera pose.
The lens distortion model is Nuke (darren Nuke?)

Say you want to stick some augmented reality textures onto the floor
or LED boards or stanchions.

These could be

* green alignment textures to see if the camera solve is bad
* advertisement insertions



```bash
